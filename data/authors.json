    "bio": "New York Governor. His parents owned a store when he grew up in Queens, and he attended St. John's Preparatory School. He played professional baseball in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, but had to quit after an injury. He completed his bachelor's degree at St. John’s University in 1953 and graduated from St. John's University Law School in 1956. He practiced law in Brooklyn and was an Adjunct Professor at St. John's Law School. Cuomo came to prominence in the late 1960s while representing New York City residents whose neighborhoods were threatened by real estate development, which led to his unsuccessful candidacy for the 1974 Democratic Lieutenant Governor’s nomination. Hugh Carey, who won the 1974 Governor's race, appointed Cuomo as Secretary of State in 1975. He ran unsuccessfully for New York City Mayor in 1977, but won the Lieutenant Governorship in 1978. He won the 1982 Governor’s election, and he served three terms. Cuomo became nationally known as a result of his 1984 Democratic National Convention keynote speech, and was considered a likely candidate for President in 1988 and 1992, though he did not run. He was defeated for reelection in 1994, after which he practiced law and authored several books.",

His work covers many aspects of the human condition.

His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase:\"Follow your bliss.\" He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his Star Wars saga.",

Bismarck's Realpolitik and firm governance resulted in his being popularly known as the Iron Chancellor (Eiserner Kanzler). Otto von Bismarck is most famous for his role in German unification. During the German Imperial period, he became a hero to German nationalists, who built monuments honouring him. Historians praise him as a visionary who kept the peace in Europe through diplomacy. He has been criticized for his domestic policies such as Catholic persecution as well as his authoritarian rule in general as Chancellor. He is also criticized by opponents of German nationalism, which became engrained in German culture and ultimately galvanized the country to aggressively pursue nationalistic policies in both World Wars.",
